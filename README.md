To get started, you will want to log in with the administrator account which is

{
    "email": "admin1@admin.com",
    "password": "admin1"
}

Once you get the token from this login, you will be able to do what you need in
the file. 

To view more detailed info, please see the swagger.yaml file in the static folder.
